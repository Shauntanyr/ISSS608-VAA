This is unusual. However, further investigation showed that these individuals were had household sizes of 2 or more, with those having household sizes of 3 were consistent with having kids. The logical explanation for this is that these are individuals who are married, and are either house-wives or house-husbands.

These peaks occur for the segments Graduates in interest Group A and E, Bachelors in interest group H, and Low Education Levels in interest groups F, G and I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nInsight\n\nCity Planners can encourage residents to pick up interest groups C and E in a bid to improve Joviality levels. This can be done through subsidies for classes, or building more facilities for the above-mentioned interest groups.\nCity Planner can monitor and further investigate the following segments of the interest groups A, E, F, G, H and I to understand the underlying reasons for the higher percentages of low joviality levels among these segments:\n\nGraduates pursuing Interest Group A and E\nBachelors pursuing Interest Group H\nLow Education individuals pursuing Interest Group F\nLow Education individuals pursuing Interest Group G\nLow Education individuals pursuing Interest Group I\n\n\nThese segments can then be effectively targeted to encourage them to pursue other interest groups which have higher correlation to higher joviality. Similarly, this can be incentivised through subsidies, grants and/or greater accessibility.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Visualising Uncertainty\nGiven that point estimates are not precise representation of the true data value, the following charts will help us to visualise the observed data, displaying the target quantile confidence levels (95%), and that the true (unknown) estimate will lie within this interval.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Base ggplot\nggplot(\n  data = df1,\n  aes(x = householdSize,\n      y = joviality)) +\n# Adding a gradient interval\n  stat_gradientinterval(   \n    fill = \"skyblue\",      \n    show.legend = TRUE) +\n  \n# Using stat_pointinterval to plot the points and intervals\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    aes(interval_color = stat(level)),\n    .width = c(0.95, 0.99),\n    .point = median,\n    .interval = qi,\n    point_color = \"darkred\",\n    show.legend = FALSE) +\n\n# Defining the color of the intervals \n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"blue2\", \"darkblue\"),\n    aesthetics = \"interval_color\") +\n  \n#Title and subtitle\n  labs(title = 'Visualising uncertainty in median estimates of Joviality by Household Size',\n  subtitle = 'Quantiles intervals (95% and 99%) of joviality levels by household size for the year',\n  x = \"Household Size\",\n  y = \"Joviality Level\") +\n  \n  theme_hc() +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that while the mean joviality level for married individuals (household size = 2) and married with kid (household size = 3) seems higher by the point estimate, there is an uncertainty associated with it and that it ranges in a band as depicted by the blue bar.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(\"ungeviz\")\n\nggplot(data = df1, \n       (aes(x = factor(educationLevel), \n            y = joviality))) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(\n    height = 0.3, \n    width = 0.05), \n    size = 0.4, \n    color = \"#0072B2\", \n    alpha = 1/2) +\n  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, \n                             group = educationLevel), \n              height = 0.6, \n              color = \"#D55E00\") +\n  theme_bw() + \n  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot also depicts the uncertainty involved in the segregating residents of the city by education level, that it cannot be said for certain that education level is a predictor of higher joviality given the uncertainty involved."

Intuitively, looking at the mean wages across the different educational level, the one-way annova test reveal that they are also statisically different, with higher educational levels, having higher mean wages.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Exploring the Variances between Wages for participants of different education levels\n\np1 <- ggbetweenstats(\n  data = df2,\n  x = educationLevel, \n  y = Wage,\n  grouping.var= category,\n  type = \"np\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE,\n  title = \"Differences in wage for different education levels\",\n  package = \"ggthemes\", palette = \"Tableau_10\"\n)\n\np2 <- ggbetweenstats(\n  data = df2,\n  x = educationLevel, \n  y = joviality,\n  grouping.var= category,\n  type = \"np\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE,\n  title = \"Differences in Joviality for different education levels\",\n  package = \"ggthemes\", palette = \"Tableau_10\"\n)\n\np2 + plot_annotation(\n  title = 'One-way Annova of Joviality across different Education Levels',\n  subtitle = 'There is significant difference between joviality of individuals of the different education levels, with more highly educated individuals having a higher likelihood of greater joviality',\n  theme = theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18), axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14)))\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\np1 + plot_annotation(\n  title = 'One-way Annova of Yearly Wage across different Education Levels',\n  subtitle = 'There is significant difference between the yearly wage of individuals of the different education levels, with more highly educated individuals having a higher likelihood of better wages',\n  theme = theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18), axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14)))\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the following chart (repeated from the EDA done above) shows a diminishing relationship - as wages increases, the joviality score decreases.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=df2, \n       aes(x= Wage, \n           y=joviality, color = educationLevel)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  \n    labs(title = 'Scatterplot of Joviality levels by Wage with Smoothing Line',\n       y = \"Joviality\",\n       x = \"Wage\") +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),\n  \n  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nInsight\n\nCity Planners should encourage residents to continually improve themselves, attaining the highest possible education level as possible. This can be done through subsidies for education, and well as policies to encourage workers in the workforce to upgrade themselves.\nChasing higher wages would not necessarily improve joviality. Therefore city planners should be cognisant of that in planning socio-economic policies - protecting and improving the lives of the bottom of society should be the focus rather than the middle to high income earners.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Significance of Shelter on Joviality\n\n\nShow the code\nz <- ggplot(data=df2, \n            aes(x = Shelter,\n                y = joviality, color = householdSize, palette = \"Tableau_10\", size = RentAdjustment)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(-20000,0),\n                  ylim=c(0,1)) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(title = 'Interactive Plot of Expenditure on Shelter vs Joviality by Household Size (color) and Rent Adjustment (size)',\n  x = \"Expenditure on Shelter\",\n  y = \"Joviality Level\") +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),\n  \n  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14)) \n\nggplotly(z)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInsight 1. With Rent Adjustment values seemingly associated with high joviality, especially those who spendd significantly on Shelter to house their larger families, city planners can rework the disbursement of rent adjustment for individuals with larger families (especially those with lower incomes), to reduce the financial burden, and improve joviality among its residents.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Significance of Expenditure on Recreation on Joviality\n\n\nShow the code\nggscatterstats(\n  data = df,\n  x = Recreation,\n  y = joviality,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  ) + theme_minimal() + \n    labs(title = 'Correlation between Expenditure on Recreation and Jovaility', subtitle = 'This chart shows that there is a 0.39 correlation between expenditure on recreation and joviality',\n       y = \"Joviality\",\n       x = \"Recreation\") +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),\n  \n  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the above chart shows that there is a positive correlation between expenditure on recreation and joviality, we need to further divide the data to gain insights of greater fidelity.\n\n\nShow the code\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Plot of joviality vs expenditure on Recreation for Household Sizes \nggscatterstats(\n  df1,\n  x = Recreation,\n  y = joviality,\n\n) + theme_minimal() + \n    labs(title = 'Correlation between Expenditure on Reacreation and Jovaility by household size', subtitle = 'This chart shows the positive correlation between expenditure on recreation and joviality drops as household size increases',\n       y = \"Joviality\",\n       x = \"Recreation\") +\n  ggplot2::geom_rug(sides = \"b\") + \n  facet_wrap(vars(householdSize)) + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),\n  \n  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\nSpiltting the data by household size, this chart show comparing joviality against expenditure on recreation across the different household sizes show that there are diminishing effect on joviality for expenditure on recreation as the household size increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nInsight\n\nTo improve the joviality level of singles, city planners can portion fund to build recreational facilities or encourage business owners to offer singles-friendly activities for this group of individuals to spend on recreation\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Significance of Interest Group on Joviality\n\n\nShow the code\n# Visual for Significant Test of Association between Interest Group and Joviality bins\ndf_interest <- df1 %>% \n  mutate(joviality_bins = \n           cut(joviality, \n               breaks = c(0,0.25,0.5,0.75,100))\n         \n)\n\nggbarstats(df_interest, \n           x = joviality_bins, \n           y = interestGroup) +\n    theme_minimal() + \n    labs(title = 'Significant test of Association Joviality levels across Interest Groups', subtitle = 'This plot show that there are differences in proportion of binned joviality levels between the participants of the different interest groups',\n       y = \"Joviality\",\n       x = \"Interest Group\") +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),\n  \n  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\nWith approximately an equal spread of participants across the various interest group, this visual explores the association between Interest Group and Joviality. Joviality values are binned into 4 equal group, with higher Joviality as more desirable. It is immediately apparent that two interest groups (C and E) are standouts with higher percentages of very high joviality (>0.75) in green.\n\n\nShow the code\n# looking at the difference between joviality by interest group - there are differences\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = df,\n  x = interestGroup, \n  y = joviality, palette = 'Paired') +\n  theme_minimal() + \n    labs(title = 'One-way Annova of Joviality levels across Interest Groups', subtitle = 'This plot show that there is a statistically significant variance for joviality between the participants of the different interest groups',\n       y = \"Joviality\",\n       x = \"Interest Group\") +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),\n  \n  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nt2.rect1 <- data.frame (xmin=0, xmax=0.5, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf)\n\nggplot(df1, aes(x = joviality, y = interestGroup, fill = educationLevel)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha=0.6) +\n  theme_ridges() + \n  theme_minimal() + geom_rect(data=t2.rect1, aes(xmin=xmin, xmax=xmax, ymin=ymin, ymax=ymax), fill=\"red\", alpha=0.25, inherit.aes = FALSE) +\n  \n    labs(title = 'Ridgeplot of Joviality levels by Education Level across Interest Groups', subtitle = 'This plot helps us visualise the peaks in the lower joviality segments of society across education levels and interest groups',\n       y = \"Interest Group\",\n       x = \"Joviality\") +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),\n  \n  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggbarstats(df1, \n           x = educationLevel, \n           y = interestGroup) +\n  \n    labs(title = 'Plot of Significant Test of Association between Interest Group for different Education Levels', subtitle = 'This plot helps us visualise the proportions of Education Level segments across education levels and interest groups',\n       y = \"Proportion\",\n       x = \"Interest Group\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),\n  \n  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the ridgeplot above which displays the joviality by interest groups, with the added fidelity of education level, a few patterns are apparent: there are noticeable peaks at the lower joviality levels of 0-0.5 (highlighted in the red box). These peaks occur for the segments Graduates in interest Group A and E, Bachelors in interest group H, and Low Education Levels in interest groups F, G and I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nInsight\n\nCity Planners can encourage residents to pick up interest groups C and E in a bid to improve Joviality levels. This can be done through subsidies for classes, or building more facilities for the above-mentioned interest groups.\nCity Planner can monitor and further investigate the following segments of the interest groups A, E, F, G, H and I to understand the underlying reasons for the higher percentages of low joviality levels among these segments:\n\nGraduates pursuing Interest Group A and E\nBachelors pursuing Interest Group H\nLow Education individuals pursuing Interest Group F\nLow Education individuals pursuing Interest Group G\nLow Education individuals pursuing Interest Group I\n\n\nThese segments can then be effectively targeted to encourage them to pursue other interest groups which have higher correlation to higher joviality. Similarly, this can be incentivised through subsidies, grants and/or greater accessibility.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.7 Visualising Uncertainty\nGiven that point estimates are not precise representation of the true data value, the following charts will help us to visualise the observed data, displaying the target quantile confidence levels (95%), and that the true (unknown) estimate will lie within this interval.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Base ggplot\nggplot(\n  data = df1,\n  aes(x = householdSize,\n      y = joviality)) +\n# Adding a gradient interval\n  stat_gradientinterval(   \n    fill = \"skyblue\",      \n    show.legend = TRUE) +\n  \n# Using stat_pointinterval to plot the points and intervals\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    aes(interval_color = stat(level)),\n    .width = c(0.95, 0.99),\n    .point = median,\n    .interval = qi,\n    point_color = \"darkred\",\n    show.legend = FALSE) +\n\n# Defining the color of the intervals \n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"blue2\", \"darkblue\"),\n    aesthetics = \"interval_color\") +\n  \n#Title and subtitle\n  labs(title = 'Visualising uncertainty in median estimates of Joviality by Household Size',\n  subtitle = 'Quantiles intervals (95% and 99%) of joviality levels by household size for the year',\n  x = \"Household Size\",\n  y = \"Joviality Level\") +\n  \n  theme_hc() +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),\n  \n  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that while the mean joviality level for married individuals (household size = 2) and married with kid (household size = 3) seems higher by the point estimate, there is an uncertainty associated with it and that it ranges in a band as depicted by the blue bar.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(\"ungeviz\")\n\nggplot(data = df1, \n       (aes(x = factor(educationLevel), \n            y = joviality))) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(\n    height = 0.3, \n    width = 0.05), \n    size = 0.4, \n    color = \"#0072B2\", \n    alpha = 1/2) +\n  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, \n                             group = educationLevel), \n              height = 0.6, \n              color = \"#D55E00\") +\n  theme_bw() + labs(title = 'Visualising uncertainty in median estimates of Joviality by Education Level',\n  subtitle = 'Quantiles intervals (95% and 99%) of joviality levels by education level for the year',\n  x = \"Education Level\",\n  y = \"Joviality Level\") +\n  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)+ theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 24), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),\n  \n  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 1),\n  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot also depicts the uncertainty involved in the segregating residents of the city by education level, that it cannot be said for certain that education level is a predictor of higher joviality given the uncertainty involved."
